                    <h2>Overview of OneBusiness Company</h2>
                    <p>PT MUNJUL PRIMA UTAMA was founded by Mr. Tris Tanoto in 1987. It has been registered with CITES no A-ID-505 since 1996. PT MUNJUL PRIMA UTAMA focuses on breeding and exporting Ultra Red Arowana Fish and now produces F1-F5 Super Reds . The quality of PT. MPU’s super red arowanas is no doubt premium quality and is well known amongst hobbyists. PT MUNJUL PRIMA UTAMA’s Ultra Red Arowana fish have been exported to various countries especially Japan, Taiwan, China, Thailand, Singapore and Korea.</p>

                    <p>The name of Ultra Red from the Japanese Arowana hobbyists. They regard PT MUNJUL PRIMA UTAMA’s Super Red Arowana Fish as the most RED Super Red Arowana Fish and therefore decide to call them ‘Ultra Red’ Arowana Fish.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Tris Tanoto also won an arowana contest held in Jakarta in 1996, in which he was allowed to participate by bringing only 1 of his Ultra Red Arowana Fish.</p>

                    <p>An Ultra Red Arowana Fish’s special markings are its red blood colour and thick scales which are 90%-100% covered by red color. The color also covers the face and tail, which blooms like flowers. It is often called ‘HONG HUA’ (Red flower). Even in young Ultra Red Arowana Fish measuring from 20-25 CM the premium quality of PT MUNJUL PRIMA UTAMA can already be seen. Mr. Tris Tanoto purposely puts his Ultra Reds in aquariums without any color in the background to show the true color of the fish. </p>

                    <p>Mr. Tris Tanoto also uses DNA identification technique to know if the super red arowana fish returned to him (from DOA’s) are his fish. According to him, implanting a microchip can’t guarantee a fish’s authenticity 100% because a microchip can be moved from one arowana fish to another. </p>

                    <p>According to Mr. Tris Tanoto, super red arowana fish can be divided into two categories; synthetic dan authentic. Synthetic Arowana Fish means medicine is applied to beautify the arowana fish, while authentic Arowana Fish is the naturally beautiful Arowana Fish. From experience, Mr. Tris Tanoto believes that gold will be gold, even when it is thrown into dirt. The same applies with super red arowana Fish with genuine genetics. Even if they are put in bare aquariums (no lighting effects), they will still look red. This is Mr. Tris Tanoto’s main principal in selecting the premium super red arowana for breeding, which results in an unmatched Ultra Red Arowana Fish quality.</p>

                    <p>His other principal is: lying to others is the same as lying to yourself. It is unethical to lie to others, and lying to yourself is worse.</p>
